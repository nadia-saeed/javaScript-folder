// SWITCH = can be an efficient replacement to many else-if statements.

// Now we will use Switch Statement:
let day = 5;
switch(day){
    case 1:
        console.log('It is Monday.');
        break;
    case 2:
        console.log('It is Tuesday.');
        break;
    case 3:
        console.log('It is Wednesday.');
        break;
    case 4:
        console.log('It is Thursday.');
        break;
    case 5:
        console.log('It is Friday.');
        break;
    case 6:
        console.log('It is Saturday.');
        break;
    case 7:
        console.log('It is Sunday.');
        break;
    default:
        console.log(`${day} is not a day.`);
